Cap 1

Cryptography is the science and study of secret writing. A cipher is a secret method
of writing, whereby plaintext (or cleartext) is transformed into ciphertext
(sometimes called a cryptogram). The process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext
is called encipherment or encryption; the reverse process of transforming
ciphertext into plaintext is called decipherment or deeryption. Both encipherment
and decipherment are controlled by a cryptographic key or keys



There are two basic types of ciphers: transpositions and substitutions. 

Transposition ciphers rearrange bits or characters in the data. 
Un ejemplo de este tipo de algoritmos es el "rail-fence" donde el texto plano se reacomoda 
con la forma de una cerca como se observa en la Figura XXXXX. En este caso la llave del algoritmos sería
la profundidad de la cerca, en el caso de la imagen es de 3.


Substitution ciphers replace bits, characters, or blocks of characters with
substitutes. A simple type of substitution cipher shifts each letter in the English
alphabet forward by K positions (shifts past Z cycle back to A); K is the key to the
cipher. The cipher is often called a Caesar cipher


A code is a special type of substitution cipher that uses a "code book" as the
key. Plaintext words or phrases are entered into the code book together with their
ciphertext substitutes, as shown next"




In computer applications, transposition is usually combined with substitution.
The Data Encryption Standard (DES), for example, enciphers 64-bit blocks
using a combination of transposition and substitution




Cryptanalysis is the science and study of methods of breaking ciphers. A
cipher is breakable if it is possible to determine the plaintext or key from the
ciphertext, or to determine the key from plaintext-ciphertext pairs. There are three
basic methods of attack: ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, and chosen-plaintext.
Under a eiphertext-only attack, a cryptanalyst must determine the key solely
from intercepted ciphertext, though the method of encryption, the plaintext language,
the subject matter of the ciphertext, and certain probable words may be
DATA SECURITY 3
known. For example, a message describing the location of a buried treasure would
probably contain words such as BURIED, TREASURE, NORTH, TURN,
RIGHT, MILES.
Under a known-plaintext attack, a cryptanalyst knows some plaintextciphertext
pairs. As an example, suppose an enciphered message transmitted from
a user's terminal to the computer is intercepted by a cryptanalyst who knows that
the message begins with a standard header such as "LOGIN". As another example,
the cryptanalyst may know that the Department field of a particular record
contains the ciphertext for Physics; indeed, the cryptanalyst may know the Department
field of every record in thedatabase. In some cases, knowledge of probable
words allows a close approximation to a known-plaintext attack. Encrypted
programs are particularly vulnerable because of the regular appearance of
keywordsue.g, begin, end, var, procedure, if, then. Even if the exact position of
encrypted keywords is unknown, a cryptanalyst may be able to make reasonable
guesses about them. Ciphers today are usually considered acceptable only if they
can withstand a known-plaintext attack under the assumption that the cryptanalyst
has an arbitrary amount of plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
Under a ehosen-plaintext attack, a cryptanalyst is able to acquire the ciphertext
corresponding to selected plaintext. This is the most favorable case for the
cryptanalyst. A database system may be particularly vulnerable to this type of
attack if users can insert elements into the database, and then observe the changes
in the stored ciphertext. Bayer and Metzger [Baye76] call this the planted record
problem.
Public-key systems (defined in Section 1.3) have introduced a fourth kind of
attack: a chosen-eiphertext attack. Although the plaintext is not likely to be intelligible,
the cryptanalyst may be able to use it to deduce the key.
A cipher is unconditionally secure if, no matter how much ciphertext is intercepted,
there is not enough information in the ciphertext to determine the plaintext
uniquely. We shall give a formal definition of an unconditionally secure cipher in
Section 1.4. With one exception, all ciphers are breakable given unlimited resources,
so we are more interested in ciphers that are computationally infeasible to
break. A cipher is computationally secure, or strong, if it cannot be broken by
systematic analysis with available resources.

called eryptology.

1.3 CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS
This section describes the general requirements of all cryptographic systems, the
specific properties of public-key encryption, and digital signatures.
A cryptographic system (or cryptosystem for short) has five components:
1. A plaintext message space, if/.
2. A ciphertext message space, C.
3. A key space, .K.
4. A family of enciphering transformations, EK: ~ ~ C, where K ~ .K.
5. A family of deciphering transformations, DK: C ~ ~, where K ~ .K.



Each enciphering transformation E K is defined by an enciphering algorithm
E, which is common to every transformation in the family, and a key K, which
distinguishes it from the other transformations. Similarly, each deciphering transformation
D K is defined by a deciphering algorithm D and a key K. For a given K,
D K is the inverse of EK; that is, DK(EK(M )) = M for every plaintext message M. In
a given cryptographic system, the transformations E K and D K are described by
parameters derived from K (or directly by K). The set of parameters describing E K
is called the enciphering key, and the set of parameters describing D K the deciphering
key. Figure 1.5 illustrates the enciphering and deciphering of data.
Cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements:
1. The enciphering and deciphering transformations must be efficient for all
keys. is essential for computer applications; data is usually enciphered
and deciphered at the time of transmission, and these operations must not be
bottlenecks.
2. The system must be easy to use.
3. The security of the system should depend only on the secrecy of the keys and
not on the secrecy of the algorithms E or D.






//
There are specific requirements for secrecy and authenticity. Secrecy requires
that a cryptanalyst not be able to determine plaintext data from intercepted
ciphertext. Formally, there are two requirements:
Secrecy requirements
- It should be computationally infeasible for a cryptanalyst to systematically
determine the deciphering transformation D K from intercepted ciphertext C,
even if the corresponding plaintext M is known.

- It should be computationally infeasible for a cryptanalyst to systematically
determine plaintext M from intercepted ciphertext C.

Requirement (1) ensures that a cryptanalyst cannot systematically determine the
deciphering transformation (guessing may be possible). Thus, the cryptanalyst will
be unable to decipher C or other ciphertext enciphered under the transformation
E g. Requirement (2) ensures that a cryptanalyst cannot systematically determine
plaintext without the deciphering transformation. Both requirements should hold
regardless of the length or number of ciphertext messages intercepted.



Data authenticity requires that a cryptanalyst not be able to substitute a
false ciphertext C' for a ciphertext C without detection. Formally, the two requirements
are:
Authenticity requirements

- It should be computationally infeasible for a cryptanalyst to systematically
determine the enciphering transformation E g given C, even if the corresponding
plaintext M is known.

- It should be computationally infeasible for a cryptanalyst to systematically
find ciphertext C' such that DK(C' ) is valid plaintext in the set M.


Requirement (1) ensures that a cryptanalyst cannot systematically determine the
enciphering transformation. Thus the cryptanalyst will be unable to encipher a
different plaintext message M', and substitute the false ciphertext C' = EK(M')
for C. Requirement (2) ensures that a cryptanalyst cannot find ciphertext C' that
deciphers into meaningful plaintext without the enciphering transformation.

Transposition ciphers rearrange characters according to some scheme.



SIMPLE SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS
There are four types of substitution ciphers: simple substitution, homophonic substitution,
polyalphabetic substitution, and polygram substitution

A simple substitution cipher replaces each character of an ordered plaintext
alphabet, denoted A, with the corresponding character of an ordered cipher alphabet,
denoted C



A homophonic substitution cipher maps each character a of the plaintext alphabet
into a set of ciphertext elements f(a) called homophones. Thus the mapping f from
plaintext to ¢iphertext is of the form.j2 A ~ 2 e.


The following illustrates a possible assignment of integers to the letters
in the message PLAIN PILOT
