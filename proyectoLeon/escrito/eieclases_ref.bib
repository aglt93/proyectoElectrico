	abstract = {We propose automated sport game models as a novel technical
	means for the analysis of team sport games. The basic idea is that
	automated sport game models are based on a conceptualization of key
	notions in such games and probabilistically derived from a
	set of previous games. In contrast to existing approaches, automated
	sport game models provide an analysis that is sensitive to their context
	and go beyond simple statistical aggregations allowing objective,
	transparent and meaningful concept definitions. Based on automatically gathered spatio-temporal data
	by a computer vision system, a model hierarchy is built bottom up, where
	context-sensitive concepts are instantiated by the application of machine learning techniques.
	
	We describe the current state of implementation of the
	ASpoGaMo system including its computer vision subsystem
	that realizes the idea of automated sport game
	models. Their usage is exemplified with an analysis of
	the final of the soccer World Cup 2006.
