Seg√∫n \cite{rivest} los beneficios de utilizar el RC5 como algoritmo de cifrado:

\begin{itemize}
\item A fixed set of parameters may be at least as dangerous, since the parameters
can not be increased when necessary. Consider the problem DES has now:
its key size is too short, and there is no easy way to increase it.
\item It is expected that implementors will provide implementations that ensure
that suitably large parameters are chosen. While unsafe choices might be
usable in principle, they would be forbidden in practice.
\end{itemize}

Otros usos del algoritmo one might consider using RC5-32/8/0
(with no secret key) applied to inputs 0, 1, 2, ... to generate a sequence of pseudo-
random numbers to be used in a randomized computation.
